# Simple HTML Test README

This repository contains a simple HTML test file (`index.html`) for exploring basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript functionalities. The HTML file includes styling from an external CSS file (`styles.css`) and a JavaScript file (`test.js`).

## File Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML file with a basic structure, including a title, styled headings, a paragraph with inline styling, and buttons to show/hide a message using JavaScript.

- **styles.css**: External CSS file containing styling rules. In this example, it sets the color of `h1` elements to red.

- **test.js**: External JavaScript file (currently commented out in the HTML file) that may contain additional functionality for showing/hiding messages.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Gingerpeer/training.git

2. Open index.html in your web browser to view the test webpage.

## Customization

Feel free to modify the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to experiment and learn more about web development. Uncomment the JavaScript code in index.html and add your own functionality to test.js.

## Notes

- The JavaScript functionality for showing/hiding messages is currently commented out in the HTML file. Uncomment and modify the code in test.js to observe its effects on the webpage.

- The external CSS file (styles.css) is linked to the HTML file to demonstrate how to separate styling from the HTML content.
